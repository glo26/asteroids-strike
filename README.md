# About Our deFi Gaming Platform:

Galaxy Gang Asteroids Strike is a blockchain-run arcade game inspired by the classic Asteroids game. Players can purchase ‘credits’ using crypto to play. It is geared toward the gaming communities in Southeast Asia, as the game allows for a lower barrier of cost to entry compared to other P2E games in the industry.

It also recognizes 'low data' mode to accommodate for more players to join the web3 community with less friction. The tech stacks used include Moralis, Polygon Chain, Firebase + Google Cloud Network, Multichain, followed by Moralis Metaverse SDK (soon).
