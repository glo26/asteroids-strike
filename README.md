# Abstract

Galaxy Gang is an indie team aiming to bring the play-to-earn experience that mobile users have been waiting for onto their smartphones through addicting games with fair gameplay and tokenomics. We want to revive the fun of casual retro gaming while rewarding committed players with token incentives and other rewards.

# Overview: Galaxy Gang - Asteroids Strike

Galaxy Gang Asteroids Strike is a blockchain-run arcade game inspired by the classic Asteroids game. Players can purchase ‘credits’ using crypto to play. It is geared toward the gaming communities in Southeast Asia, as the game allows for a lower barrier of cost to entry compared to other P2E games in the industry. It also recognizes 'low data' mode to accommodate for more players to join the web3 community with less friction.

A game running on the Polygon Chain created for the Galaxy Gang Universe, modeled after the infamous Asteroids-style Retro Style. We will also follow with 'Crazy Rich Club' within the Galaxy Gang Universe in fixing the problem of lack of transparency in defi gaming ecosystem. The tech stacks used include Moralis, Polygon Chain, Firebase + Google Cloud Network, Multichain, followed by Moralis Metaverse SDK (soon).
